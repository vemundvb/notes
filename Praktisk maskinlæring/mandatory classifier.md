pairwise statistical tesring,
multiple observations from several methods that are coupled, that are somewhat randomly split.
to fix we can run multple training and testing, then ull get paired results (results from testing and training relating). Then we can compare them. but there are more than pairwise.
there is also precision, recall, f-measure. they can be used on testing, which can give extra perspective on how well there doing

X
. there is also ROC (reciver operation characteristics), which is visual tool 
There is also confusion matrices. very usefull with classification.
there is also ROC curves and AUC

X
precision and recall wikipedia, ser man flere formler,
men de viktigte er precision og recall.
precision and recall kan bli kombinert, til noe som kalles f1 mesaure

X
burde bruke en del metrics ting fra sklearn.


man har også:
Pairwise statistical testing:
student.t test,
wilcoxon signed rank
mcNemar test - tror det gir continues table, kan brukes direkte på klassifiserer, burde inkluderes.
